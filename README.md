# Alaska_wind_chill
Days with extreme wind chill in Alaska are decreasing in frequency, especially at lower elevations, and with a reduced length of season, according to numerical simulations which account for large-scale mean-state climate conditions.
Here we provide cuscom codes that used in calculating the frequency and timing of EWCDs from both Historical (CTRL) and PGW simulations using circular statistics. This is for a research paper "Climate change reduces the wind chill hazard across Alaska" submitted to Communications Earth & Environment.
